## MOD installation

This plugin is not yet in the MOD Audio plugin store.
However, you can download the latest MOD Dwarf build from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Octaver/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.
